## Technology Used
* **React** (FrontEnd)
    * **Styled-Components** 
* **Fauna Db** (cloud database)
* **Netlify**
    * **Servesless functions**
    * **Hosting**

### Fauna Db Setup
* Create a Database in [Fauna DB](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) and generate a KEY.
* Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, and place the database KEY inside it as shown below
``` env
    FAUNA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR-DATABASE-KEY
```
* From the Fauna Db project dashboard, create a new collection called **notes** and add a first document with structure similar to the object shown below
``` javascript
    {
        title:"My Favorite Food items",
        text:"apples üçé,chocolate üç´, ice cream üç¶"
    }
```
* Go to the Shell from Fauna Project dashboard and run the below query, that will create an Index with which we can get all notes in descending order of the edited time.
``` javascript
    CreateIndex({
        name: "note_sort_by_ts_desc",
        source: Collection("notes"),
        values: [{ field: ["ts"], reverse: true }, { field: ["ref"] }]
    })
```
